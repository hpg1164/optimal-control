Apply modal predective (MPC) in non-holonomic motion robot the optimal control problem is converted into the non-linear programming by using the single shotting method and control the path of differential drive robot by using the point stabilization and the varaitation in the control and state is optimization .


linear velocity and angular velocity is analyze according to our condition
